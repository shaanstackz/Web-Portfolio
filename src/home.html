            <h3>Origins and Interests</h3>
          <p>Born in 2002 in the lively Greater Toronto Area, I've called this diverse region home for as long as I can remember. However, my family's roots lie in India, particularly in the capital city of New Delhi. Growing up, I've been lucky to experience the vibrant mix of Canadian and Indian cultures, which has influenced the way I see the world. Living in Toronto, with its diversity of cultures, has taught me to appreciate different cultures and has given me a sense of belonging in a global community. My Indian heritage is an integral part of who I am, shaping my traditions, language, and connections with family. This blend of Canadian living and Indian roots defines my journey, guiding my experiences and shaping my dreams for the future.</p>
            <p>Growing up, I have developed numerous interests over the years. In particular, sports identify a great part of me, and I have grown up watching the NBA and English Premier League from a very young age. As I grew up watching LeBron James, I greatly follow and support him as I believe his journey and way of playing basketball is something no one can replicate. I regularly support his endeavours with the Los Angeles Lakers, and will continue to do so. On the other hand, I support the Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League. Although not a big club, I have greatly admired the way they play football over the years.</p>
            <p>I am also a frequent movie-goer and have great fear of missing out when a movie that peaks my interest comes out. My favourite movies include The Departed, Inception, The Hangover, and The Intouchables. Similarily, I also watch a lot of TV shows. My favourite TV show is How I Met Your Mother, and it is a show I regularly rewatch. Other shows I greatly enjoy include Game of Thrones, The Boys, Person of Interest, and Better Call Saul. Other media I greatly enjoy are video games and music.</p>
            <p>In terms of music, I greatly admire the hip-hop and R&B genres. Growing up, I warmed up to the lyrical attribution of rap music and how it impacts the community. I also enjoy movie soundtracks, specifically ones composed by Hans Zimmer. In terms of video games, I am a big fan of the Uncharted series. I was first introduced to this series when I got my PS4 and it came with the collection. The cinematics, gameplay, and mechanics are something that I believe no game can replicate. Other favourites of mine include Cyberpunk 2077, Persona 5, Pokemon HeartGold, and The Walking Dead Telltale Series.</p>
            <p>My family and I are also frequent travellers. We have travelled to more than 15 countries and continue to travel at least once every year. We have mainly visited numerous European destinations and they are something which we have greatly explored. My favourite destination is a tie between Switzerland and Greece. In Switzerland, the way of living and the mountainous regions seemed so unreal to me as it was something I have never seen before in my life. Jungfrau in particular was an area which honestly created one of the best days of my life. Greece on the other hand, had islands which were greatly mesmerising. In particular, Santorini is a place I can stay forever. There is so much culture to explore, as well as so many places to go by sea.</p>
